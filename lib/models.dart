It’ll either be served 1/2 and 1/2 or 1/3 espresso to 2/3 water, depending on the coffee shop in question or how you’ve chosen to brew it. There is dispute about whether the espresso or the water should be added first, but in the case of the americano, espresso should always be added first as the crema mixes in and creates a more mellow, even taste. But some people may add it depending on their personal preference. Whilst most other espresso-based coffee drinks include milk, such as the cappuccino or latte, the americano stands out amongst them.'
